    <div class="intro-text-about" >
        <p class="intro-text-about">My passion for technology began in sixth grade, with robotics classes. In high school, I started considering a technical course and, luckily, I was sent to Systems Analysis and Development at IFSC, where I began learning programming and completed my training in 2023.

            After graduation, I worked as a young apprentice at a start-up, where I learned a lot about development and had the opportunity to study and grow in an environment with experienced professionals. Over time, I took on small demands and, after 11 months, I was hired. My first solo project was challenging, but it helped me evolve a lot in the quality of my deliverables.
            
            Now, at 18 years old, after 2 years at the company, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in college and explore robotics even further, an area that has always fascinated me. In addition, I am very close to my little brother and work as an assistant at the Christian Congregation, which inspired me to consider pedagogy as a second college option.
            
            In my work, I mainly program in React, Node.js and NoSQL, but I also have experience with Java, PHP, SQL and other technologies.</p>
